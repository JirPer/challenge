after that, open it with your IDE via new Project from VCS. Then just run it in your IDE, or down right here in shell windows, or via cmd in directory containing duplicated repo:

- gradlew.bat build
- gradlew.bat bootrun
- gradlew.bat test

**BUILD**
```shell
gradle.bat build
```
**BOOTRUN**

```shell
gradle.bat bootRun
```

**TEST**

```shell
gradle.bat test
```

**Next tasks in this project:**
- definitely more usual functions for REST API - PUT, DELETE, more complex GET
- sorry, wasn't able to put in Docker, as I'm not familiar with it
- time approx: 1:50h
